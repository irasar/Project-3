## Description 


Are you tired of overpaying for forgotten, overdue subscriptions? SubAway is the app for you! SubAway is a MERN stack subscription service manager, that allows users to track all of their subscriptions right in one place. Upon logging in, the user will be able to disclose the amount of money they would like to spend, with our budgeting system. They are then able to start adding their many subscriptions. These subscriptions will be displayed in order of severity, with the closes due shown at the top. We ultilized React Datepicker and Moment.js to create this feature. The subscriptions are also colorcoded green, yellow, and red to further help the user manage their services. You are also able to delete unwanted subscripions from your list. SubAway is a responsive application so you can enjoy it on a variety of devices.
